# BonziWORLD 2 Replica (Alternate)
A replica of 72.23.210.24:8880 (BonziWORLD 2, August 2020?). Onute Saulute (IUS) used to go there and used scripts to flood BonziWORLD 2. I hate flooders. They break the rules.

Like BonziWORLD.co, it's peaceful than bonzi.lol (now bonziworld.org). Don't go to bonziworld.org.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD 2 to be placed and run the following:

cd BonziWORLD 2 Replica Alternate
```



### Server
```
node index.js

After this, BonziWORLD 2 will be accessible. (http://localhost/)

I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
